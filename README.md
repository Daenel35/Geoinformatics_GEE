The project comprised the development of an open access script that allows the user to access, visualize, browse, and retrieve a customized view of the best available historic data for a given area.
The script is made publicly available by both a shareable URL and a GitHub repository with the code and the technical report. GEE users must register/sign in through a Gmail account.

All relevant documentation can be found at:

Script can be directly accessed through:

Use case asset (AOI) can be found at:

Script customization and expansion is possible and actively encouraged. Script can also be optimized in length by the means of recursive functions and server-side conditionals.
